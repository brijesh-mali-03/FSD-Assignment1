    <h2>History of Java: </h2>
    <p>History of java: The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.

    The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started the project in the early '90s.</p>

    <u><strong>Java v/s CPP: </strong></u>
    <p>Answer: The main difference between C++ and Java is that C++ is only a compiled language while Java is both compiled and interpreted. The C++  compiler converts the source code into machine code and therefore, it is platform dependent. However, Java source code is converted into bytecode by its compiler and following that, the Java interpreter executes this bytecode at runtime and produces output. The fact that Java is interpreted is the reason as to why it is platform independent.</p>
